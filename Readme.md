## What is MongoDB

MongoDB is a database offered by the company of the same name. The database was officially named MongoDB, with “Mongo” being short for the word humongous.

## How it works

Where in SQL world, we have Schemas and tables, In MongoDB is a **NoSQL** solution, here we have collections, these collections we have so called documents.. these documents looks like JavaScript Objects.

**Documents are stored in JSON (BSON) data format, in key value pairs.**

We can store nested data in there, which makes working with Complex data super efficient, where in SQL we would had to Join tables, from table A, table B etc, Here we can save it in a logical way directly in database instead of maintaining relationships.

## Schemaless architecture

MongoDB provides flexible Schemaless architecture, where MySQL would scream if we our one record looks different from other, SQL is strict about having all the records under some Schema so all the records share same attributes where in MongoDB, One document can totally be different from the other.
